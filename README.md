# instigitr [![GNU GPL](http://img.shields.io/:license-gpl3-blue.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

instigitr is a single file command line utility for creating git repos and
initializing their README. It also creates a `.gitignore`, and I plan to add
support for many languages and other doo-dads.

## Installation

* run `install.sh` to install to your home directory's `bin` dir.

## Usage

1. create a directory for your new repo: `mkdir my-new-repo`
1. cd into the new directory: `cd my-new-repo`
1. `$ instigitr` and type Y

## Contributing

1. Fork it
1. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
1. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
1. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
1. Submit a pull request

## History

You are staring at the beginning of the repo. It is very immature at the
moment.
